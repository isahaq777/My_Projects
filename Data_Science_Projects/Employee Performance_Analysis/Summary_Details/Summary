Department-wise Performances:

Our analysis revealed significant differences in performance across departments. Some departments demonstrated consistently higher performance ratings, while others showed room for improvement. These insights help identify where targeted interventions (such as additional training or changes in management practices) are needed.

Based on our analysis, the most important features influencing employee performance were determined to be:

1. EmpLastSalaryHikePercent
2. EmpEnvironmentSatisfaction

Key Takeaways
- The Stacking Ensemble model performed the best with an accuracy of 93%.
- All models showed strong predictive power, with precision-recall values above 80% for all classes.
- Class 2 had slightly lower recall, which means some employees in this category may be misclassified.
