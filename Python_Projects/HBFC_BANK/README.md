# HBFC Loan Customer Analysis

## Overview

The HBFC Loan Customer Analysis project involves building a predictive model using logistic regression to determine which customers the bank should approach for lending loans. The goal is to develop a model that provides valuable insights for strategic decision-making and optimizing loan offerings.

## Introduction

The HBFC Loan Customer Analysis Project involved developed logistic regression model to identify potential loan customers, providing valuable insight for strategic decision-making and optimizing loan offerings using Bank_Personal_Loan_Modelling Excel file which contains the data which I have used for this project.

## Project Steps

### 1. Import Necessary Libraries

Brief summary of the libraries I have imported in my project:

1. **pandas (as pd):**
   - Purpose: Data manipulation and analysis.
   - Use Case: Reading and exploring datasets.

2. **numpy (as np):**
   - Purpose: Numerical computing and array operations.
   - Use Case: Handling numerical data efficiently for better visualization.

3. **seaborn (as sns):**
   - Purpose: Data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
   - Use Case: Creating aesthetically pleasing statistical graphics.

4. **matplotlib.pyplot (as plt):**
   - Purpose: Comprehensive 2D plotting library.
   - Use Case: Plotting graphs and charts.

5. **sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder:**
   - Purpose: Encoding categorical variables.
   - Use Case: Transforming categorical variables into numerical format.

6. **sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split:**
   - Purpose: Splitting datasets into training and testing sets.
   - Use Case: Dividing data for model training and evaluation.

7. **sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix:**
   - Purpose: Calculating a confusion matrix for evaluating classification models.
   - Use Case: Assessing the performance of a classification model.

8. **sklearn.metrics.classification_report:**
   - Purpose: Generating a text report showing the main classification metrics.
   - Use Case: Providing a detailed summary of model performance.

9. **sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score:**
   - Purpose: Calculating the accuracy of a classification model.
   - Use Case: Measuring the overall correctness of the model.

10. **sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression:**
    - Purpose: Implementing logistic regression models.
    - Use Case: Building and training a logistic regression model.

11. **sklearn.metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay:**
    - Purpose: Displaying a confusion matrix with a visual representation.
    - Use Case: Visualizing the confusion matrix for better interpretation.

These libraries cover a wide range of tasks, from data handling and visualization to machine learning model training and evaluation.

### 2. Load and Explore the Data

The dataset is loaded into pandas DataFrame and explore its structure.

### 3. Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The approach to analyzing and visualizing the dataset for better understanding. The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process and visualization contains 12 steps in analyzing the dataset. All of that is explained in project. 

### 5. Train-Test Split

The data is split into training and testing sets.

### 6. Build and Train the Logistic Regression Model

In this step the logistic regression model is created, Data is divided into two parts training data set and testing data set.

### 7. Evaluate the Model

The model's performance is evaluated on the testing data set.

### 8. Interpret the Results

The interpretation of the confusion matrix and classification report to understand the model's performance.
